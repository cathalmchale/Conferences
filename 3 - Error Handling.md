Using the debugger, at least the first time, to ensure that queues are correctly created

Run projects in the following order:

* NSB03SampleReceiver
* NSB03SampleSender

After all the retries the poison message will be in "error" queue.

Once queues are created correctly endpoints can be run in any order. Generally speaking in production queues are created upfront at deploy time.
